@article{Tan2005,
abstract = {Cluster analysis divides data into groups (clusters) that aremeaningful, useful, or both. If meaningful groups are the goal, then the clusters should capture the natural structure of the data. In some cases, however, cluster analysis is only a useful starting point for other purposes, such as data summarization. Whether for understanding or utility, cluster analysis has long played an important role in a wide variety of fields: psychology and other social sciences, biology, statistics, pattern recognition, information retrieval, machine learning, and data mining. There have been many applications of cluster analysis to practical prob- lems. We provide some specific examples, organized by whether the purpose of the clustering is understanding or utility.},

	abstract = {Experimentation is crucial to human progress at all scales, from society as a whole to a young infant in its cradle. It allows us to elicit learning episodes suited to our own needs and limitations. This paper develops active strategies for a robot to acquire visual experience through simple experimental manipulation. The experiments are oriented towards determining what parts of the environment are physically coherent-that is, which parts will move together, and which are more or less independent. We argue that following causal chains of events out from the robot{\textquoteright}s body into the environment allows for a very natural developmental progression of visual competence, and relate this idea to results in neuroscience.},
